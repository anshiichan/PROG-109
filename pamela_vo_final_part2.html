				<h2>Questions</h2>
				<p>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?<br />
				<ul><li>I learned basic HTML many many years ago, basic structure and tables. I basically had to relearn everything since I forgot most of the content. I had no prior knowledge of CSS or Javascript prior to taking this course.</li></ul><br />
				Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?<br />
				<ul><li>I based the design off of the Module 4 assignment which was built from scratch and I tried to streamline the design and feel of the site.</li></ul><br />
				What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)<br />
				<ul><li>The most challenging thing for me was trying to get the CSS styling to provide the output in a manner that I expected. Granted the user experience may vary from browser, device, etc. But I remember how much time I spent on trying to resolve overlapping CSS style conflicts, tweaking attributes and their corresponding values.</li></ul><br />
				How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? <br />
				<ul><li>Any type of coding can be unforgiving, so the tiniest mistake can render your code unusable. I appreciate having the knowledge so that I have the ability to design my own basic sites in the future.</li></ul><br />
				What would you recommend to future students taking this class?<br />
				<ul><li>With any online course, it takes a lot of discipline and structure to ensure that you are keeping up with the content. The web is a very valuable resource if you need to learn more about a specific element/tag/etc.</li></ul></p>
